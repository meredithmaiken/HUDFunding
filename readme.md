The Housing and Urban Development Authority (HUD) is the federal affordable housing authority. Towns, regional governments, municipalities and other entities are able to apply for grants and funding from HUD. This map shows cumulatively how much funding each state receives in millions. The datasheet these numbers were pulled from breaks the numbers down into individual entities within the state in most cases.  The name of the organization insinuates urban development. With prior knowledge of population distribution in the United States, the spatial pattern you can pick up on is that there are more funds awarded to states with higher population density. In the western part of the US where population is the sparsest, funding is generally the lowest. There also seems to be a loose, visual correlation between states in the Southeastern US and more HUD funding. The creation of this map allows for an initial examination of spatial patterns in HUD funding in the US and should prompt further and closer investigation.
